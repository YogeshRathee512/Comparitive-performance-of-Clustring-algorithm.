# Pycaret Clustering on Jewellery Dataset

- Installed Pycaret for machine learning tasks.
- Loaded the jewellery dataset and set up K-Means clustering.
- Explored different preprocessing techniques and clustering configurations:
  - No preprocessing
  - Normalization (z-score)
  - Transformation (Yeo-Johnson)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Combination of normalization, transformation, and PCA
- Created functions to apply clustering models (K-Means, MeanShift, HClust) with varying cluster numbers.
- Plotted evaluation metrics such as the elbow graph and silhouette plot for each model.
